# AgeOfXianxia - Pages [here](https://karaalor.github.io/AgeOfXianxia/)
## About
New game project for mix of xianxia and asatru lore.  Development is still very early and all features / design goals are subject to change.

## Prerequisites
Releases come bundled with all the files needed to execute the program.

## Prerequisites (Building)
This project is built inside a docker so all you need to build this is to create our docker image.
Docker build config can be found [here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kyrasuum/Configs/main/dev_docker.txt)

This project utilizes [Armory3d](https://github.com/armory3d/armory) which is build on [Kha](https://kha.tech/) (written in [haxe](https://haxe.org/)).
Armory needs to therefore be installed in order to build this project.
Follow tutorial [here.](https://github.com/armory3d/armory/wiki/setup)
Armory builds using blender (should be installed via docker config) which means blender needs to have armory added as a plugin.

## Building
Building is done via the armory release button in its toolbar.

## Design Goals
    * RPG mechanics
    * 3D graphics
    * basic animatinos
    * multiple camera styles
    * multiplayer
as always, development is early so all goals are subject to changes.

## Acknowledgements
We utilize Armory3d, Kha, and Haxe so leave credit where credit is due.

## Versioning
Releases will be versioned and packed into a zip for convenience each release will be incremental in verison number.
